# QR-Code-Generator

Greetings,

I am pleased to introduce a rudimentary QR code generator, which I have developed while venturing further into the realm of backend development. This project marks my initial foray into this domain, and I welcome you to explore, contribute, or fork it as you see fit.

To employ this generator effectively, kindly ensure that you specify the correct directory in your terminal install the packages and execute the program. Following that, please provide a valid working URL, and the generated QR code in PNG format as well as the text will be updated with each subsequent use.

Wishing you a productive coding experience! :D
